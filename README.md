allowing you to embed and control Dailymotion videos directly within your Flutter app.
It supports:

- Native video playback with full SDK features.
- Player customization via Dailymotion parameters.
- Event handling (play, pause, end, errors, etc.).
- Integration with both iOS and Android platforms.

This plugin is ideal for developers who want seamless Dailymotion video playback
without relying on WebViews or third-party wrappers, leveraging the official SDKs
for better performance and feature support.
